# AHSentinel

**Market analysis, sniper and gold-making toolkit for the auction house – for every WoW version.**

> ⚠️ **This addon is in beta.** It may still contain bugs. If you run into an error or unexpected behaviour in-game, please report it in the comments – ideally with the Lua error message (if any) and the WoW version you play on.

> 🔁 **Formerly "AH Analyzer Pro".** Since version 0.62.0 the addon is called **AHSentinel**. Your saved data is taken over automatically on the first login. The zip now contains only the folder `AHSentinel` – if the old folder `AHAnalyzerPro` is still in your AddOns, AHSentinel tells you once in the chat: just delete it. The new command is `/ahs` (`/ahp` still works).

AHSentinel scans the auction house, keeps a price history for every item and turns it into market values, trends and charts. It finds bargains for you, helps you sell at the right price and keeps a ledger of everything you earn and spend. It opens in its own resizable window with just five tabs – **Overview, Buy, Sell, Market, Ledger** – can be used completely with the mouse and speaks the language of your WoW client.

## What's new

### Version 0.65.125

- **Less stutter – compact price history in memory:** in game AHSentinel now keeps the price history as one compact
  number list per item instead of one table per price entry (tens of thousands fewer Lua objects; garbage collection
  has much less work). Saved data stays exactly as before; all values are unchanged.
- **Accounting – repair corrected:** for invoices that were booked twice next to pending sales, the purchase cost now
  goes onto the invoice (the goods are sold) instead of back into stock. If you already started 0.65.124, this is
  corrected once afterwards (backup kept). The repair only counts as done once it has run without errors.
- The tempo test shows the price history tables. Tests T643, T644.

### Version 0.65.124

- **Accounting – profit only from confirmed sales:** auctions that sold but whose payment has not arrived by mail yet
  ("pending") no longer count in profit; they are shown separately as "in transit". Pending entries older than 24 h
  without an invoice are flagged in the tooltip.
- **Invoices in large lots:** an invoice for e.g. 72 items now confirms several small pending entries of the same item
  (summed by quantity) instead of booking a second sale.
- **One-time repair:** pending entries already covered by an invoice that was booked as a new sale are marked "replaced
  by invoice" (nothing deleted, a backup is kept). No more double counting between invoice and pending.
- Test report: profit old/new, number of resolved entries, gold reconciliation since the start date. Tests T640–T642.

### Version 0.65.123

- **Shared command list:** the list while typing `/ahs` now comes from the shared GoldSentinel file
  (GoldSentinelCmdHint.lua), the same for all GoldSentinel addons. Use stays the same (click selects, Tab/Shift+Tab,
  Enter runs); your usage counters are kept.
- Speed test (`/ahs testroutine tempo`): memory of AHSentinel broken down by area (size and number of tables) in the
  test report.
- Tests T638, T639.

### Version 0.65.122

- **Disenchanting – final rules per material group:** 20 % minimum profit for groups your results prove and also for
  groups not measured yet, as long as the disenchant table matches your measured results (within ±10 %); 25 % only if
  the table deviates; 30 % for groups that measured badly. No budget cap per group. In the game you only see whether it
  pays or not – the rules appear only in the test report.
- Test T637 updated.

### Version 0.65.121

- **Disenchant value was corrected far too much (important):** the material price correction (×0.57) used the median of
  a random result – mostly cheap dust, rarely an expensive essence or shard. On average the prediction was right
  (≈ 0.96). Now the correction uses sums (total loot / total prediction, from 30 cases), so "Worth up to", the sniper
  maximum and the profit line are realistic again. The learned safety margin for disenchanting uses sums too.
- **Minimum profit for disenchanting per material group:** 20 % for groups your own results prove (≥ 30 purchases,
  total profit ≥ 20 %), 25 % for groups not proven yet (and at most 20 % of the disenchant budget per group to learn
  them), 30 % only for groups that measured badly. Weapons and armour of the same level band count together.
- Test report: total profit per group (loot / spent) and the minimum profit that applies.
- Tests T589, T637.

## Features

### Today – what makes the most gold right now
- One button (or `/ahs today`) lists the best actions right now, sorted by net profit: flips, buying below vendor or disenchant value, selling from your bags, reposting returned auctions
- **Every row has a button with the next step – right in the list:** *Check* shows the real current offer, *Buy* buys it (never more expensive and never more than suggested), flips then get *Post*
- **Crafting:** profitable recipes you already know, with a button that adds the missing reagents as buy rows (with **ProfessionSentinel** also missing recipes, vendors and drops, step by step)
- **Capital protection:** together at most half of your gold, no single suggestion above 20 %

### Market data
- **Full market scan** with price history for every item
- **Market value** = weighted median of the last 14 days – newer prices count more, so it follows a price crash quickly; silly prices like "1666g 99s 98c" don't count
- **Price crash detection:** the tooltip says "price just crashed", and such items are not suggested
- **Sell-through estimate:** how many sell per day and how reliable the market value is
- **Trends and charts** with time-based EMAs and crossover markers
- **Bait-offer protection** and automatic re-checks of suspiciously cheap prices
- **Price sync** between all players using the addon
- Prices and a small price chart in **every item tooltip**, plus vendor price and disenchant value

### Buying
- **Categories like the Blizzard auction house:** every main category with its sub-categories (Weapons → One-Handed Axes …, Armor → Cloth/Leather …), names and order straight from the game
- **Sniper:** targets with max price, quantity, budget, rarity, item level and level filters – searches on its own while the auction house is open
- **Bargain watcher:** herbs, ore, cloth, leather, enchanting, elemental, gems, cooking and more – anything at or below x % of market value (default 50 %); never weapons or armour. When you start the full scan, it has priority: the watcher pauses until the scan has run
- **One-notch buying** with the mouse wheel or your own key binding
- **Stackable goods combined** (classic auction house): same unit price = one row with the sum and the total price; Shift+click several rows and buy them together
- **Shopping lists** with quantities – check all prices at once or turn missing items into sniper targets; items already in your bags are subtracted
- **Watchlist** with alerts

### Selling
- **Sell → Post:** price check and undercut suggestion (1 copper, 1 % or 5 %), deposit, AH cut and proceeds – warns when a vendor pays more or when you would sell below your purchase price
- **WoW Forever:** the deposit of at least 1 silver per auction is never refunded there – AHSentinel counts it in every profit calculation and suggests the vendor when the fee eats the AH profit
- **Series posting:** posts every bag item with a remembered price, one click per auction
- **Sell → My auctions:** status of your auctions (lowest / tied / undercut / sold), cancel with one click
- **Collect AH mail:** gold and items from all auction mail with one click (COD is never paid)

### Profit & bookkeeping
- **Ledger:** income after the AH cut, spending, deposits and profit for today / 7 days / 30 days / all time – read from your mailbox invoices, nothing counted twice
- **Statistics:** sell-through per item, best selling hours and weekdays
- **Buy → Bargains:** below market value, below vendor price or below disenchant value, bids and flip recommendations, sorted by realistic profit per day; flipping calculator
- **Disenchanting learns together:** your disenchant results are shared with all AHSentinel players (or only your guild), so the drop chances match the server much sooner
- **Professions:** material cost, value of the result and profit for every recipe, best recipes, materials straight to a shopping list
- **Vendor prices** are learned automatically at every merchant – including items that cost a currency (e.g. Merchant's Favor on WoW Forever)
- **Alts & gold:** gold, bags and bank of all your characters, gold history of the last 30 days
- **CSV export**

### Comfort
- **Five tabs** with sub-tabs, price history in its own window, sniper and watcher switchable in the title bar
- Two designs: **Classic** (looks like the WoW auction house) and **Modern**
- Item search by name in any language, by item ID or by shift-click, with suggestions while typing
- Built-in item name list (~33,000 items in 10 languages, incl. The Burning Crusade); lists always show names in your chosen language
- Help page for every tab, right-click menu on every item, minimap button
- **Robust saved data:** a single damaged entry (e.g. after a crash while saving) is repaired on login instead of causing a Lua error
