# AHSentinel

**Market analysis, sniper and gold-making toolkit for the auction house – for every WoW version.**

> ⚠️ **This addon is in beta.** It may still contain bugs. If you run into an error or unexpected behaviour in-game, please report it in the comments – ideally with the Lua error message (if any) and the WoW version you play on.

> 🔁 **Formerly "AH Analyzer Pro".** Since version 0.62.0 the addon is called **AHSentinel**. Your saved data is taken over automatically on the first login. The zip now contains only the folder `AHSentinel` – if the old folder `AHAnalyzerPro` is still in your AddOns, AHSentinel tells you once in the chat: just delete it. The new command is `/ahs` (`/ahp` still works).

AHSentinel scans the auction house, keeps a price history for every item and turns it into market values, trends and charts. It finds bargains for you, helps you sell at the right price and keeps a ledger of everything you earn and spend. It opens in its own resizable window with just five tabs – **Overview, Buy, Sell, Market, Ledger** – can be used completely with the mouse and speaks the language of your WoW client.

## What's new

### Version 0.65.176

- **More thorough sniper check (`/ahs testroutine sniper`):** at the open auction house the test now watches your own
  targets (a test target if you have none) and measures: pace (searches per minute against the server limit of 90),
  whether all targets get their turn, whether hits are correct (only up to the max price, marked gold), money safety
  (nothing sent; for the test purchase gold before − after = booked price), pauses (the sniper resumes by itself),
  missed hits and stutter (no frame longer than 33 ms). The result is at the very top of the report in a few plain sentences.
- Still nothing is bought without your wheel notch/key.

### Version 0.65.175

- **Sniper speed measured:** each sniper session (from switching on to off) is measured – searches, average and highest
  searches per minute, number of targets – only real sniper searches, never the test routine. The test report shows the last
  session. The row text is shorter ("12 s ago").
- **"Today":** a "price fell" row only appears if selling now is really worth it (at least 1s and more than waiting).

### Version 0.65.174

- **Sniper checks ALL targets:** every target in your list is searched in turn, equally often, as fast as the server allows
  (before, a target with hits was searched much more often and the others rarely). Each row shows "checked x s ago"; a row
  with a waiting hit is marked gold. Buying still only by click; budget and max per row apply. Test T727.

### Version 0.65.173

- **Accounting:** the tooltip over "Profit" now shows exactly four lines – proceeds, invested, fees, profit – with the same
  numbers as the header. "Profit %" is simply profit ÷ invested of that line; if the line contains items without purchase
  price it shows "–" (the tooltip says how many). Profit and % never have different signs.
- **"Today":** rows that turned out "no longer worth it" are no longer shown; the flip part calculates in smaller steps.
- Full scan: slow event handlers of AHSentinel are now measured and named at the longest frame (to find the remaining stutter).

### Version 0.65.172

- **Market tab simpler:** only "Today" and "Disenchant" are shown – Flip, Vendor, Gaps, Crowded and Trends are not backed by
  your own data yet and are hidden (option "Market: all views (experts)"). A sentence on top: only what pays off with your data.
  Test T723.
- **Disenchant:** groups you have not measured yet are extrapolated from your own disenchants (all measured groups together,
  at most +10 %, from 100 disenchants on) and marked grey "extrapolated from n own disenchants". Test T724.
- **"Today":** sorted by profit again after quantities were limited; calculates in smaller steps (less stutter). Interface
  "worth up to" returns the same value as the tooltip (also for vendor/auction way). Best recipes are not recalculated twice
  within 2 seconds. Tests T725, test routine fixes.

*Older versions: see the changelog of each file in the **Files** tab.*

## Features

### Today – what makes the most gold right now
- One button (or `/ahs today`) lists the best actions right now, sorted by net profit: flips, buying below vendor or disenchant value, selling from your bags, reposting returned auctions
- **Every row has a button with the next step – right in the list:** *Check* shows the real current offer, *Buy* buys it (never more expensive and never more than suggested), flips then get *Post*
- **Crafting:** profitable recipes you already know, with a button that adds the missing reagents as buy rows (with **ProfessionSentinel** also missing recipes, vendors and drops, step by step)
- **Capital protection:** together at most half of your gold, no single suggestion above 20 %

### Market data
- **Full market scan** with price history for every item
- **Market value** = weighted median of the last 14 days – newer prices count more, so it follows a price crash quickly; silly prices like "1666g 99s 98c" don't count
- **Price crash detection:** the tooltip says "price just crashed", and such items are not suggested
- **Sell-through estimate:** how many sell per day and how reliable the market value is
- **Trends and charts** with time-based EMAs and crossover markers
- **Bait-offer protection** and automatic re-checks of suspiciously cheap prices
- **Price sync** between all players using the addon
- Prices and a small price chart in **every item tooltip**, plus vendor price and disenchant value

### Buying
- **Categories like the Blizzard auction house:** every main category with its sub-categories (Weapons → One-Handed Axes …, Armor → Cloth/Leather …), names and order straight from the game
- **Sniper:** targets with max price, quantity, budget, rarity, item level and level filters – searches on its own while the auction house is open
- **Bargain watcher:** herbs, ore, cloth, leather, enchanting, elemental, gems, cooking and more – anything at or below x % of market value (default 50 %); never weapons or armour. When you start the full scan, it has priority: the watcher pauses until the scan has run
- **One-notch buying** with the mouse wheel or your own key binding
- **Stackable goods combined** (classic auction house): same unit price = one row with the sum and the total price; Shift+click several rows and buy them together
- **Shopping lists** with quantities – check all prices at once or turn missing items into sniper targets; items already in your bags are subtracted
- **Watchlist** with alerts

### Selling
- **Sell → Post:** price check and undercut suggestion (1 copper, 1 % or 5 %), deposit, AH cut and proceeds – warns when a vendor pays more or when you would sell below your purchase price
- **WoW Forever:** the deposit of at least 1 silver per auction is never refunded there – AHSentinel counts it in every profit calculation and suggests the vendor when the fee eats the AH profit
- **Series posting:** posts every bag item with a remembered price, one click per auction
- **Sell → My auctions:** status of your auctions (lowest / tied / undercut / sold), cancel with one click
- **Collect AH mail:** gold and items from all auction mail with one click (COD is never paid)

### Profit & bookkeeping
- **Ledger:** income after the AH cut, spending, deposits and profit for today / 7 days / 30 days / all time – read from your mailbox invoices, nothing counted twice
- **Statistics:** sell-through per item, best selling hours and weekdays
- **Buy → Bargains:** below market value, below vendor price or below disenchant value, bids and flip recommendations, sorted by realistic profit per day; flipping calculator
- **Disenchanting learns together:** your disenchant results are shared with all AHSentinel players (or only your guild), so the drop chances match the server much sooner
- **Professions:** material cost, value of the result and profit for every recipe, best recipes, materials straight to a shopping list
- **Vendor prices** are learned automatically at every merchant – including items that cost a currency (e.g. Merchant's Favor on WoW Forever)
- **Alts & gold:** gold, bags and bank of all your characters, gold history of the last 30 days
- **CSV export**

### Comfort
- **Five tabs** with sub-tabs, price history in its own window, sniper and watcher switchable in the title bar
- Two designs: **Classic** (looks like the WoW auction house) and **Modern**
- Item search by name in any language, by item ID or by shift-click, with suggestions while typing
- Built-in item name list (~33,000 items in 10 languages, incl. The Burning Crusade); lists always show names in your chosen language
- Help page for every tab, right-click menu on every item, minimap button
- **Robust saved data:** a single damaged entry (e.g. after a crash while saving) is repaired on login instead of causing a Lua error
