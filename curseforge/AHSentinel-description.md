# AHSentinel

**Market analysis, sniper and gold-making toolkit for the auction house – for every WoW version.**

> ⚠️ **This addon is in beta.** It may still contain bugs. If you run into an error or unexpected behaviour in-game, please report it in the comments – ideally with the Lua error message (if any) and the WoW version you play on.

> 🔁 **Formerly "AH Analyzer Pro".** Since version 0.62.0 the addon is called **AHSentinel**. Your saved data is taken over automatically on the first login. The zip now contains only the folder `AHSentinel` – if the old folder `AHAnalyzerPro` is still in your AddOns, AHSentinel tells you once in the chat: just delete it. The new command is `/ahs` (`/ahp` still works).

AHSentinel scans the auction house, keeps a price history for every item and turns it into market values, trends and charts. It finds bargains for you, helps you sell at the right price and keeps a ledger of everything you earn and spend. It opens in its own resizable window with just five tabs – **Overview, Buy, Sell, Market, Ledger** – can be used completely with the mouse and speaks the language of your WoW client.

## What's new

### Version 0.65.16

- **Protected values:** the recipe selection and the diagnostic log ignore protected game values instead of touching them.
- Developer test routine (developer only), following the rules that proved themselves for LevelPilot: honest counting
  (checks that cannot run in a client count as skipped, never as OK; the report states "not automated: N" and lists
  everything to check in the game), each bug found in the game is its own test (recipe click without a previous click,
  the 50-second delay), bait values for protected values, the test log goes to a sandbox, test IDs are unique.

### Version 0.65.15

- **Diagnostic log:** `/ahs protokoll` (or `/ahs log`) opens a window with a copyable log – version, client, sessions,
  changed settings, open windows and where the profit window is docked, plus entries (newest first): CLICK (recipe,
  recipe ID, way, milliseconds, success), BUILD (best-recipes list, trigger, time), SLOW (any step over 16 ms),
  OVERLAP (another window covering the profit window) and ERROR (same error only counted). On logout it is also stored
  as "GSDIAG1" for the addon check. No player, character, guild or realm names.

### Version 0.65.14

- **Profession window (modern client):** clicking a recipe in "Best recipes" selects it right away through the
  recipe list of the profession window and scrolls it into view – in the same moment, without waiting for a timer.
  Only if that is not possible the game's OpenRecipe is used; the addon checks every frame and reports in the chat
  if the recipe is not shown within 0.5 seconds.

### Version 0.65.13

- **WoW Forever – profit next to the profession window:** the deposit (at least 1 silver per auction, never refunded)
  is now deducted and shown as its own line: profit = value × 0.95 − materials − deposit (e.g. Copper Chain Pants 18c
  instead of 1s 18c – the same as ProfessionSentinel). The best-recipes list is ranked with it.
- **WoW Forever – bid deals** also deduct the deposit for re-selling.
- Classic Era, TBC and other versions are unchanged (there the deposit comes back on sale).

### Version 0.65.12

- **Profession window – clicking a recipe in "Best recipes" now always opens it:**
  - the list no longer rebuilds on every game event: events are collected and the list is rebuilt at most every
    0.4 s, only when something changed, spread over several frames – a click is no longer lost during a rebuild;
  - each row remembers its recipe; the click looks up the recipe again in the profession window, and if a search text,
    filter or collapsed category hides it, these are reset and the recipe is opened anyway;
  - if it still cannot be opened, a short message appears in the chat.

*Older versions: see the changelog of each file in the **Files** tab.*

## Features

### Today – what makes the most gold right now
- One button (or `/ahs today`) lists the best actions right now, sorted by net profit: flips, buying below vendor or disenchant value, selling from your bags, reposting returned auctions
- **Every row has a button with the next step – right in the list:** *Check* shows the real current offer, *Buy* buys it (never more expensive and never more than suggested), flips then get *Post*
- **Crafting:** profitable recipes you already know, with a button that adds the missing reagents as buy rows (with **ProfessionSentinel** also missing recipes, vendors and drops, step by step)
- **Capital protection:** together at most half of your gold, no single suggestion above 20 %

### Market data
- **Full market scan** with price history for every item
- **Market value** = weighted median of the last 14 days – newer prices count more, so it follows a price crash quickly; silly prices like "1666g 99s 98c" don't count
- **Price crash detection:** the tooltip says "price just crashed", and such items are not suggested
- **Sell-through estimate:** how many sell per day and how reliable the market value is
- **Trends and charts** with time-based EMAs and crossover markers
- **Bait-offer protection** and automatic re-checks of suspiciously cheap prices
- **Price sync** between all players using the addon
- Prices and a small price chart in **every item tooltip**, plus vendor price and disenchant value

### Buying
- **Categories like the Blizzard auction house:** every main category with its sub-categories (Weapons → One-Handed Axes …, Armor → Cloth/Leather …), names and order straight from the game
- **Sniper:** targets with max price, quantity, budget, rarity, item level and level filters – searches on its own while the auction house is open
- **Bargain watcher:** herbs, ore, cloth, leather, enchanting, elemental, gems, cooking and more – anything at or below x % of market value (default 50 %); never weapons or armour. When you start the full scan, it has priority: the watcher pauses until the scan has run
- **One-notch buying** with the mouse wheel or your own key binding
- **Stackable goods combined** (classic auction house): same unit price = one row with the sum and the total price; Shift+click several rows and buy them together
- **Shopping lists** with quantities – check all prices at once or turn missing items into sniper targets; items already in your bags are subtracted
- **Watchlist** with alerts

### Selling
- **Sell → Post:** price check and undercut suggestion (1 copper, 1 % or 5 %), deposit, AH cut and proceeds – warns when a vendor pays more or when you would sell below your purchase price
- **WoW Forever:** the deposit of at least 1 silver per auction is never refunded there – AHSentinel counts it in every profit calculation and suggests the vendor when the fee eats the AH profit
- **Series posting:** posts every bag item with a remembered price, one click per auction
- **Sell → My auctions:** status of your auctions (lowest / tied / undercut / sold), cancel with one click
- **Collect AH mail:** gold and items from all auction mail with one click (COD is never paid)

### Profit & bookkeeping
- **Ledger:** income after the AH cut, spending, deposits and profit for today / 7 days / 30 days / all time – read from your mailbox invoices, nothing counted twice
- **Statistics:** sell-through per item, best selling hours and weekdays
- **Buy → Bargains:** below market value, below vendor price or below disenchant value, bids and flip recommendations, sorted by realistic profit per day; flipping calculator
- **Disenchanting learns together:** your disenchant results are shared with all AHSentinel players (or only your guild), so the drop chances match the server much sooner
- **Professions:** material cost, value of the result and profit for every recipe, best recipes, materials straight to a shopping list
- **Vendor prices** are learned automatically at every merchant – including items that cost a currency (e.g. Merchant's Favor on WoW Forever)
- **Alts & gold:** gold, bags and bank of all your characters, gold history of the last 30 days
- **CSV export**

### Comfort
- **Five tabs** with sub-tabs, price history in its own window, sniper and watcher switchable in the title bar
- Two designs: **Classic** (looks like the WoW auction house) and **Modern**
- Item search by name in any language, by item ID or by shift-click, with suggestions while typing
- Built-in item name list (~33,000 items in 10 languages, incl. The Burning Crusade); lists always show names in your chosen language
- Help page for every tab, right-click menu on every item, minimap button
- **Robust saved data:** a single damaged entry (e.g. after a crash while saving) is repaired on login instead of causing a Lua error
